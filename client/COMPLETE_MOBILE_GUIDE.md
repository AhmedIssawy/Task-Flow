## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Android Studio installed (you have this)
- ‚úÖ Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- ‚úÖ Android SDK and build tools
- ‚úÖ Node.js and npm

### Project Structure
```
client/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ android/                 # Native Android project (generated by Capacitor)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ capacitor.config.ts      # Capacitor configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json            # Updated with mobile scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ next.config.ts          # Updated for mobile compatibility
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                    # Your existing Next.js app
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ COMPLETE_MOBILE_GUIDE.md # This guide
```

### Available Mobile Scripts
```bash
# Start development server with live reload
npm run mobile:dev

# Build the app and sync to Android
npm run mobile:build

# Sync web assets to Android (after making changes)
npm run mobile:sync

# Open project in Android Studio
npm run mobile:open
```

---

## üìñ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Verify Setup
Run the verification script to ensure everything is configured correctly:
```bash
cd client
node verify-mobile-setup.js
```

You should see all green checkmarks ‚úÖ. If any checks fail, the script will tell you how to fix them.

### Step 2: Transfer to Android Studio OS
Since you have Android Studio on another OS:
1. Copy your entire project folder to the OS with Android Studio
2. Navigate to the `client` folder
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

### Step 3: Development Workflow

#### Option A: Live Development (Recommended)
1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run mobile:dev
   ```
   This command does two things:
   - Starts your Next.js development server on `http://localhost:3000`
   - Syncs your web assets to the Android project

2. **Open in Android Studio:**
   ```bash
   npm run mobile:open
   ```
   OR manually:
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Click "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to `your-project/client/android`
   - Click "OK"

3. **Run on device/emulator:**
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete (may take a few minutes first time)
   - Click the "Run" button (green play icon) in Android Studio
   - Select your target device (emulator or physical device)
   - The app will install and run with live reload!

#### Option B: Build and Test (Production Mode)
1. **Build the production app:**
   ```bash
   npm run mobile:build
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio:**
   ```bash
   npm run mobile:open
   ```

3. **Generate APK:**
   - In Android Studio: Build ‚Üí Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) ‚Üí Build APK(s)
   - APK will be created in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

### Step 4: Setting Up Your Device

#### Using Android Emulator:
1. In Android Studio: Tools ‚Üí AVD Manager
2. Click "Create Virtual Device"
3. Choose a device (e.g., Pixel 6)
4. Select a system image (API 30+ recommended)
5. Click "Finish" and start the emulator

#### Using Physical Android Device:
1. Enable Developer Options on your device:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
2. Enable USB Debugging:
   - Settings ‚Üí Developer Options ‚Üí USB Debugging
3. Connect device via USB
4. Allow USB debugging when prompted

## üîß Development Tips & Best Practices

### Making Changes

#### Web Code Changes (Most Common):
1. Edit files in `src/` as usual (components, pages, styles)
2. Changes appear automatically in the mobile app (live reload)
3. No need to rebuild or sync for web code changes

#### Configuration Changes:
1. Edit `capacitor.config.ts` for app settings
2. Run `npm run mobile:sync` to apply changes
3. Restart the app in Android Studio

#### Native Android Changes:
1. Edit files in `android/` directory
2. Rebuild the app in Android Studio
3. These are rare - most changes are web-based

### Live Reload Setup
- Your app connects to `http://localhost:3000` during development
- Make sure `npm run mobile:dev` is always running
- Changes to your React/Next.js code appear instantly in the mobile app

### Debugging Your App

#### Web Console (Recommended):
1. Open Google Chrome
2. Navigate to `chrome://inspect`
3. Click "inspect" next to your device
4. Use Chrome DevTools just like web development!

#### Android Logs:
- In Android Studio: View ‚Üí Tool Windows ‚Üí Logcat
- Filter by your app package: `com.taskflow.app`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. "Could not connect to development server"
**Problem:** App shows connection error
**Solutions:**
- Ensure `npm run mobile:dev` is running
- Check that your device can reach `localhost:3000`
- For physical devices, you may need to use your computer's IP address

**To find your IP:**
```bash
# Windows
ipconfig

# macOS/Linux
ifconfig
```

Then update `capacitor.config.ts`:
```typescript
server: {
  url: 'http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000',  // Replace with your actual IP
  cleartext: true
}
```

#### 2. Gradle Build Errors
**Problem:** Android Studio shows build errors
**Solutions:**
- File ‚Üí Invalidate Caches and Restart
- Build ‚Üí Clean Project, then Build ‚Üí Rebuild Project
- Check that you have the correct Android SDK installed

#### 3. App Crashes on Startup
**Problem:** App closes immediately after opening
**Solutions:**
- Check Android Logcat for error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Try rebuilding: `npm run mobile:build`

#### 4. Changes Not Reflecting in App
**Problem:** Code changes don't appear in the mobile app
**Solutions:**
- Ensure `npm run mobile:dev` is running
- Run `npm run mobile:sync` manually
- Restart the app on the device
- Check Chrome DevTools for JavaScript errors

#### 5. Keyboard Issues
**Problem:** Keyboard doesn't behave properly with forms
**Solution:** The mobile CSS has been configured to handle this automatically. If issues persist, check that `globals.css` contains the mobile keyboard styles.

#### 6. Authentication Issues
**Problem:** Login doesn't work in mobile app
**Solutions:**
- Ensure your backend server is running
- Check that API URLs are correct
- Verify CORS settings in your Express.js server allow mobile requests

## üöÄ Advanced Configuration

### Customizing App Settings

#### App Icons & Splash Screen
Currently using placeholders. To customize:
1. Replace icons in `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/`
2. Update splash screen in `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/`
3. Run `npm run mobile:sync`

#### App Permissions
Edit `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` to add/remove permissions:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

#### Capacitor Configuration
Edit `capacitor.config.ts` for app behavior:
```typescript
const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.taskflow.app',
  appName: 'Task Flow',
  webDir: '.next',
  server: {
    androidScheme: 'https',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',  // Development
    cleartext: true
  },
  android: {
    allowMixedContent: true
  }
};
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Production:
1. **Remove development server URL:**
   ```typescript
   // In capacitor.config.ts, comment out for production:
   // url: 'http://localhost:3000',
   ```

2. **Enable code splitting:**
   ```typescript
   // In next.config.ts
   experimental: {
     optimizeCss: true,
   }
   ```

3. **Optimize images:**
   - Use WebP format when possible
   - Compress images before including in app
